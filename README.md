# ESP32-Real-Time-Motion-Capture-Object-Animation-for-Blender
This project enables real-time motion capture and object animation in Blender using an ESP32 microcontroller. It utilizes Wi-Fi and UDP communication to send bone rotations and object positions from the ESP32 to Blender, allowing for real-time skeletal and object-based animations.
